## Usage
Once the user pressed the button on the screen they are taken to another page where the left side has all the notes. The right side is where the user can start typing their tasks or notes in. There is a save button in the top right corner of the page that allows the user to save the task to the left side of the screen. There is a trash can button that is displayed so the user can delete their task or notes when they are done.
